## Debug Duck Adventure Project

### A funny Code Debug Game.!

### How it works:

#### The player types JavaScript commands to fix bugs like declaring variables, creating functions, or making the duck quack.

#### The duck celebrates each success and throws in some programming humor along the way.

#### You can easily embed this in your team's internal tools, share it as a fun break activity, or even hide it as a secret page accessible by a special URL or key combination. It's guaranteed to get some smiles and maybe even a few genuine chuckles when they discover the hidden Easter eggs!
